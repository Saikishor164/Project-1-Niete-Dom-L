Task Overview

Our challenge is to build an agency website as a team.

The website should give potential clients:

An introduction to your agency
Information about each member of your team
A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with you

Acceptance Criteria

To reach our user stories goals, we'll need to achieve these requirements:

Navigation menu
‘About us’ section
Contact form
A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button

User Stories

The potential clients will want to:

See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are
Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
Contact you to enquire about working with you
Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name

Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:

Navigate your website using keyboard controls
Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website
